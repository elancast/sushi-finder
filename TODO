TODO:
- refactor score factors to be more flexible
- penalty for fusion
- penalty for not having certain items (uni, other items)
- contribute to score by overall review


ISSUES WITH MENU:
- need to look at all menus
- missing mixed details" 'details ' items


SILLY IDEA: Similarity and dissimilarity to known ones
How it'll work: vectors of normalized word counts
|Training - New| = score of similarity

T: [ 1, 2, 0, 3 ] => [ .167, .333, 0, .5 ]
N: [ 0, 1, 0, 0 ] => [    0,  .25, 0,  0 ]
